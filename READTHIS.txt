Okay, So here is the txt file that i will use as a change log, or update log.
Any update about a progress, or finding should be updated to this file.

Today, we are going to learn about variables and functions.

Variables are like X and Y in Mathematics , however the X and Y here can store more than just a number.
There are several variables type that are available in javascript.
There are integer, float, string, boolean, array, object, and maybe something else, but these
are the ones that i frequently used.
You can read what are those for beter understanding.

Functions are something that do something.
Functions are like the secret magic of programming, but in fact, well, it is just a script
written and prepared to do something.
However function will need to be invoked, before you can see its effect.
How to abstract a thing into a function is also a very important skill.

Lets say, this is a restaurant, then you have chef, waiter, and manager.
Chef function will be cooking, cutting and stuff,
Waiter function will be receiving order, refilling water, and stuff,
Manager function will be managing cashier and stuff..

So, we have three functions here which will execute their task.
But what if there is a new role call intern.
Intern can do chef and waiter job.
If we create another function called waiter, then we give them capabilities of cooking, and receiving
order, then dont you think we are doing redundancy? You see, this is only one new role, what if there
are 10?

Then, we know that, this is not the right abstraction. Instead of abstracting it by role, why dont we
abstract it by an activity? So there will be
cooking function, cutting function, etc. In this way, we only write it once and reuse it forever.

This is the fundamental concept of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and also simple, as the complexity
become lesser if you abstract it this way, which satisfy the concept of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).
