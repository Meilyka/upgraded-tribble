3. Stage All
4. Commit
5. Push

The goal of task one is to help you familiarize with the environment a bit.
There are three subjects that you will have to go through, which are:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

We will go through each small task assigned to each subject, and get closer to 
finish a workable application.
So here is task 1

JS task: 
- Change alert addition (+) to multiplication (*). 
    * Along the way, you can try division (/), and subtraction(-) too

CSS tasks:
- Change the dark grey header background color to something else. Refer to color code in http://htmlcolorcodes.com/

Reflection (Read this upon completion):
Here you can see that JS has the responsibility to be the brain of the whole system. 
It does what is invisible to normal people, and is a set of you which you ask to perform 
certain operation.

CSS on the other hand is the "clothes", which care about display.
