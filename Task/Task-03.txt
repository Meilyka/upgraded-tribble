Estimated time needed : 1 hour
Focus : JS logic 
difficulty : Hard (for now)

In this part, lets apply back task one concept to get you more familiarize
In task one, i setup a file named index.html.
we abandon that for now, and now please:

1. create a new file in the same directory level as index.html
2. name it something related to this task, maybe name-register.html

In this file, copy paste over all the content from index.html, and DONT FORGET to save after that.
Now, remove an input type="number", as we only need one input type.
And then between the button tag, change "calculate" to save

Then the remaining input type="number", please change it to string.

Now, what you should accomplish is :

    "Let user key in their name, and then when they click on the save button, save their credential"

Hint :
Please use javascript localstorage method setItem.

Achievable :
When you think it is correct, right click on browser, choose inspect, then go to application tab
Find the storage Local Storage, then check if the key and value is correct or wrong.
